varibles: container

Identifiers: name of that container.
Literals: value store inside that container.
Staticaly typed: before create any varibles we need to define types of that varibles.

#### Datatypes in JAVA:
    Primitive: 
        Integer: byte, short, int, long
        Real no.: float, double
        Character: char
        Boolean: boolean
    Non-Primitive:

---> every no. is signed in JAVA.
#### Range of Integers:
    byte: 8
    short: 16 
    int: 32
    long: 64
#### Range of Real no.:
    float: 32 (single precision)
    double: 64 (double precision) // good for calculation

#### Range of Character: 
    char: (16bits) to represent "unicodes" not ASCII

    unicodes: gives every charcter of world language to a Number.
    this Number is converted into binary number and store in the memory.
    that binary is represent a number or a character using Datatypes. 

#### Range of Boolean: 
    true / false
