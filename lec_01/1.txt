### Why JAVA

Problem of C/C++:
    1. Portability:
            ---> c/c++ are platform dependent language. you need to recomplie that C/C++ code for that platform, you can use that.
            ---> you cann't just use that complied code in other platform. that complied code may not bo run in that platform.
            ---> For C/C++ complier will generate different binary code for different platform.
            (Q) What is platform? : (Processor + OS)
            (Q) How different OS create different binary ?
                ---> different have different system libraries to convert instruction to binary (Mac can have different system calls, Windows can have different system calls)
            (Q) How different Processor create different binary?
                ---> between Program and Processor, we have ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) which convert program into small instructions (like, ADD STORE LOAD JUMP).
                ---> and different processors have different ISA.
    2. Simplicity:
            1. pointers
            2. Multiple Interitances
            3. Manual memory allocations / deallocations.
    3. Security:


Feature of JAVA: (how JAVA solve this problem?)
    1. Portable (WORA: write ones, run anywhere)
            using (BYTECODE):
            ---> first we need to install JVM (java virtual Machine) inside the Platforms. Java Complier we complie JAVA code into BYTECODE. and that BYTECODE will convert into the binary using JVM.
            ---> But JVM are platform dependent.
    2. Simple
            JAVA removes :
                    1. pointers
                    2. Multiple Interitances
                    3. Manual memory allocations / deallocations.
    3. Secure
            JVM provides a Secure Env. for BYTECODE to run. (Sandbox model)




### Can C/C++ be Platform Independent ?
    ---> Yes It can 
    ---> for that Micrsoft created C# (mix of C/C++ and JAVA's Bytecode concept)
